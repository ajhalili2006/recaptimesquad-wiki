# Onboarding at RecapTime.dev

Welcome to Recap Time Squad and congratulations on being the newest team member or community maintainer here!

## Things to Remember

There is a lot of information presented during your onboarding weeks, and there is no expection for you to be an expert immediately.
You don't actually need to speed-run through the onboarding steps in one week, but if you need help
chime into the `#staff-onboarding` Zulip channel.

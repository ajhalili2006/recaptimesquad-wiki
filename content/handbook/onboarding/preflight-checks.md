# Before Your First Day

You got the message that your application to join the team is accepted, and completed the paperwork. Now, before your first day as mentioned there, there's some preparations you need to do 

## Squad Internal SSO and Mailbox

Moments after you receive the application confirmation email, you'll be sent a invite
from Google to sign into your new Internal SSO account that you will use for Tailscale, Cloudflare One
and other apps. You'll be prompted to reset the password of that account and enable
two-factor authentication afterwards (make sure to have your phone ready for TOTP/passkey setup).

For your email, you'll be emailed about our mailserver alongside with
your email credentials and settings for your mail client to use.
See [this page](../email.md) for more details.

## Important - Set up your Bitwarden vault

!!! Using `vault.recaptime.dev` for personal use?
    We recommend setting an organization for personal use or a seperate personal account.

We run a [Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden) server on Hack Club Nest
as well as on Koeyb for reduancy at `vault.recaptime.dev`, which @ajhalili2006 use for both personal and open-source work.

### Alternate option - using 1Password

Our fiscal sponsor has teamed up with 1Password 

## Zulip

We use Zulip as our team communication app and virtual HQ.
After setting up your email and SSO, login or sign up to Zulip using your Google Cloud Identity account. If
you are there before, you will need to change your Zulip account's email address into your staff one.

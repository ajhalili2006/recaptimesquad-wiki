# About the handbook

Our team handbook is where we document processes, functions and everything in between.

## History of the handbook

Since Recap Time Squad is currently an one-man operation (and obviously not a company), it is important for ~ajhalili2006 (our [SABDFL](../sabdfl.md)) to have everything about the squad being documented in case of [being hit by a bus](https://www.michaelbromley.co.uk/blog/but-what-about-the-bus-factor/)
or (hopefully this don't happen but that's the worst case scenario) [die by suicide (as a high risk individual)](https://www.spectrumnews.org/features/deep-dive/hidden-danger-suicide-autism/).[^1]

[^1]: That's depressing for some, but as an neurodivergent/autistic person, it's a unholy mess of trauma and mental health issues over the years.

Most parts of the handbook are adopted from the [GitLab Handbook](https://handbook.gitlab.com), licensed under the same license as the one we use for wiki content and adopted for the squad.

## Handbook Interpretation

The handbook is subject to interpretation. We do our best to be as clear as possible to minimize confusion and/or misinterpretation. We also recognize that we have a global audience and that may bring different interpretations. If you have any questions or need further clarification please check with the content owner of the page. When in doubt please reach out and ask.

**Remember that [everything is in draft](./values.md#everything-is-in-draft) at Recap Time Squad and subject to change, this includes our handbook.**

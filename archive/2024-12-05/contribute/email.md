# Contributing via email patches

We use sourcehut lists to accept merge requests in form of email patches generated by Git.
Even through we do use GitHub + GitLab, mishaps on the send-MRs-via-email configuration happen, so we have a backup.

## For starters

If you never experienced the Git email workflow before, try [following the tutorial](https://git-send-email.io/) first, courtesy of [sourcehut](https://sourcehut.org/).

Note that you do not need to sign up to sourcehut's hosted instance as a contributor,
although it's help with associating patches to your username, as well as using
web features that requires an account.

## Setting up

```shell
# instead of using the squad's meta public inbox, we use project-specific
# mailing list for the wiki
git config sendemail.to "~recaptime-dev/devel@lists.sr.ht"

# since we're using our devel inbox, add te prefix first
git config sendemail.preifx "PATH wiki"

# We want to use the annotate flag every time we send email patches.
# (saves to your global config, so replace with --local when working within
# an ephemeral dev environment)
git config --global sendemail.annotate yes

# We don't want to ask anyone to sign a CLA over email (and it might go wrong),
# so we require anyone to sign-off in accordance to the terms of Linux DCO.
git config format.signOff yes
```

# About this wiki

**Recap Time Squad Wiki** is the meta wiki for Recap Time Squad, from the team handbook
to our operational cookbooks as a open-source organization. It is statically hosted on
Cloudflare Pages to save costs on compute (instead of running a MediaWiki instance somewhere
and storage (media is stored seperately from the wiki sources with Storj DCS).

While [Andrei Jiroh](./profile/ajhalili2006.md) is the wiki maintainer here,
anyone can [contribute](./contribute/index.md) since it is a open-source project.

## Purpose

The Squad Wiki serves distinct roles, which are all closely related but
often involve different aspects of the organization and subsets of users.

1. **Radical transparency around how we operate**, in particular writing the [team handbook](./handbook/index.md)
as a operational guidebook and [documenting anything behind the scenes](./organization/index.md).
While the organization runs by single person, it is serves as a way to ensure smooth transition towards the
path to community-led maintainership (or as Open Collective and others
call it "exit to community" (E2C)).
2. **Formulation and maintenance of [Recap Time Squad projects](./projects/index.md)** through documentation,
coordination and planning. The central venue for discussion is
our [Zulip Cloud instance], [meta issue trackers] and the [`meta.recaptime.dev`](./organization/sourcehut/mailing-lists.md) mailing list on sourcehut.

[Zulip Cloud instance]: ./organization/zulip.md
[meta issue trackers]: ./handbook/issue-trackers.md

## Companion

Since the Squad Wiki exist as a static site, we build companion tooling
around it to ensure that it is well supported even though we do not
run a MediaWiki instance ourselves.

* [**Zulip**](./organization/zulip.md) - We use Zulip both for development and coordination between the community
and the team as we work in the public.
* [**The meta mailing list on sourcehut**](./organization/sourcehut/mailing-lists.md#meta) - For those who use plaintext emails, we alo run a mailing list on sourcehut
for more asynchorous discussions regarding the wiki.
* [**Squad Meta Issue Trackers**](./handbook/issue-trackers.md#meta) - We utilize GitHub and GitLab Issues for issues relating to the wiki and our operations.

## What Meta is not

* A forum for personal essays about the organization, projects and its people.
    * Due to the nature of static docs sites, we do not accept merge requests specializing in that for now.
    It might change in the future or possibly added into our blog as an alternative option.
* A place to describe [Material for Mkdocs] and/or HCB (Hack Club's fiscal sponsorship program and platform).
    * These have their own communities and documentation sites outside of our purview.

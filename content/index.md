# Welcome to Recap Time Squad Wiki

The official wiki for everything about the organization, its members and the projects we do.
Maintained as part of [the Community Lorebooks project][project-meta], the home of
[Recap Time Squad][org]'s documentation projects and our free subdomain service for
digital garden and documentation sites. Think of it as the Wikimedia Foundation's [Meta-Wiki],
where we coordinate and document about Recap Time Squad projects, its history and the people
behind them.

While it is fairly a work in progress because @ajhalili2006 is working between projects and life, we'll
try to be as comprehensive as possible in case he gets hit by a bus.

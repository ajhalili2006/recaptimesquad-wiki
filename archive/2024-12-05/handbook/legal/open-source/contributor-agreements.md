# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

## Recap Time Squad's perspective

While we do not require signing our CLAs (based off the FLA by the FSFE) besides signing-off
commits per the DCO due to legal burden on contributors as well as additional barrier to entry,
we're may experiement requiring it on some projects under copyleft licenses in the future.

## Individual vs Corporate CLA

### Individual

An Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA) is an agreement between a contributor solely
(not in an employment capacity) and the project asserting the sole individual has the authority to
contribute. Any employee executing an ICLA is doing so in their own personal capacity and not as part
of Recap Time Squad's legal entity. As such, the ICLA will follow you should you leave Recap Time Squad.
Due to obligations of professional responsibility, attorneys for Recap Time Squad (and possibly its fiscal
host, TBD) cannot advise individuals on contracts executed in a personal (non-employee) capacity.

That said, employees have the benefit of having OSPO and Legal as resources so please use us! CLAs are binding
agreements and as a precaution, should be reviewed. Further, if you are contributing as a Recap Time Squad employee,
a representation in an ICLA that Recap Time Squad has given you permission to contribute is needed. Section 4 of the
Apache ICLA makes the representation that the contributor has permission from their employer (Recap Time Squad or our
fiscal host, depending on your contract) to submit code owned by them and says:

> If any third party (such as your employer(s)) has rights to any portion of any of Your Contributions, you represent
> that such third party has authorized your submission of such Contributions or that such third party has waived such
> rights for such Contributions.

As long as the ICLA is approved by our legal team, Recap Time Squad is okay with individuals who work at
Recap Time Squad executing ICLAs and making the representation above.

### CCLA

A Corporate Contributor License Agreement (CCLA) is an agreement between a corporation and a corporation. OSPO and Legal
does not support proceeding with a CCLA and encourages contributors to instead proceed with an ICLA. If you wish to proceed
with a CCLA, you as the contributor will be responsible for maintenance of the CCLA. This includes adding and removing of
contributors when needed. Feel free to reach open an issue in this repo for further guidance on CCLAs.

## Small Code Exception

Generally, if your contribution constitutes as a small code contribution, you do not need a CLA. Recap Time Squad defines
a small code contribution as a bug fix, or trivial patch.

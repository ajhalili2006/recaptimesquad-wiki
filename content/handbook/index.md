# Crew Handbook

!!! info
    The Recap Time Squad Crew Handbook is a guide to working at the Recap Time Squad as a community maintainer or even a squad member, while the entire Recap Time Squad Wiki (where the Crew Handbook resides) is where we document everything about the organization itself in one place, often in the public. It's our employee handbook where we note down everything from the style guide, onboarding and offboarding, and more.

    If you are reading this on `wiki.recaptime.dev`, and you don't currently a community maintainer or team member at Recap Time Squad, some content may have links to internal tooling gated behind Tailscale or Squad Internal SSO.

This handbook is your field guide on being part of Recap Time Squad as a community maintainer
(that's how we call our non-staff maintainers and moderators) or even a regular squad member. Inspired by the prior art of both [GitLab Handbook] and [Automattic Employee Field Guide], this
handbook serves as a operating manual on how to run Recap Time Squad and its projects while
minimizing the risk of being abandoned coming from the current BDFL state (hence minimizing
the effects of @ajhalili2006 being hit by a bus).

While the crew handbook is and will be always a working draft, there are some places where
we may mention internal tooling or link to resources that are

# Handbook Support

## Where to send patches?

**On GitHub**: Our Git mirror for the wiki is linked to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/sites/recaptime-squad-wiki/overview), so you can send a merge request there and expect the CI to catch up there.

**On GitLab**: We'll be doing some CI/CD work to make deploys work on Netlify without upgrading to Enterprise plan (yet).

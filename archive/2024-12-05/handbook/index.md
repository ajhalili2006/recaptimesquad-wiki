# Squad Handbook

!!! warning "May contain broken links"
    The handbook is being polished behind the scenes, so some links might error out with 404s.

The Recap Time Squad Handbook is the central repository for how we run the organization.
As an open-source organization/company, the handbook is open to the world, and we welcome feedback and patches.

Most of the handbook written here are based off and inspired by [GitLab Team Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook), with major modifications to adapt to our needs.

For internal version of the handbook, go to [our internal wiki](https://wiki.crew.recaptime.dev/handbook) and sign in with your [Internal SSO account](./company/internal-sso.md).
